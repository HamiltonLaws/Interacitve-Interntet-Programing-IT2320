			<h1>Hello Everyone</h1>
			<h2>What VideoGames Mean to me</h2>
			
			<p>
				I first started playing videoGames when I was young. I initaly started
				Playing on the Nintendo 64 and a old computer that ran Windows 98 
				in the basment. That is were I found my love for videoGames and enjoed how 
                they made me and my sisters closer. Now that I an trying to find a job
                im looing to try and start my own videoGame developmet firm. In doing so 
				I am aming to make games that will bring people closer together, make them 
				think about the world around them, and mostly to bring entertainment into the world.
