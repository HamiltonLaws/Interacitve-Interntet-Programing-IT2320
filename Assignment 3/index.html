			<h1>Hello Everyone</h1>
			<h2>What Videogames Mean to Me</h2>
			
			<div class = "Standard-paragraph">
				I first started playing Videogames when I was young. I initially started
				Playing on the Nintendo 64 and an old computer that ran Windows 98 
				in the basement. That is where I found my love for Videogames and enjoyed how 
                they made me and my sisters closer. Now that I am trying to find a job
                Iâ€™m looing to try and start my own videogame development firm. In doing so 
				I am aiming to make games that will bring people closer together, make them 
				think about the world around them, and mostly to bring entertainment into the world.
